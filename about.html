                    <p>We met via a matchmaker on SawYouAtSinai.com. On our first phone call, I thought he was a little
                        pretentious… until I realized he was a nerd just like me. We laughed, talked some more, and
                        texted afterward, both secretly excited about where this might go.</p>

                    <p>I came down to D.C., and we spent our first date walking along the Mall of America after dinner.
                        My feet got blisters, but we barely noticed—we were too busy talking, laughing, and joking that
                        the grate at the D.C. War Memorial was the entrance to the Mole People Embassy. By the end of
                        the night, we knew we wanted more adventures together.</p>

                    <p>Our third date was a day trip to Philadelphia. We wandered around the city, shared snacks, and
                        laughed at little things only we seemed to notice. By the end of the day, we were already
                        collecting inside jokes that would stick with us forever.</p>

                    <p>For Hanukkah, Matthew sent me a stuffed penguin, whom I’ve named Flipper Waddlesworth. We have a
                        whole penguin shtick going, inspired by the song “Personal Penguin” by Sandra Boyton. I’d sent
                        him the song saying I wanted to be his personal penguin, and he responded with Flipper—our own
                        little inside joke that still makes us giggle every time we see him.</p>

                    <p>I invited myself over for Shabbat, and in hindsight, we’re both so happy I did. Otherwise, it
                        would have been over a month before we saw each other again! Candles, blessings, and laughter
                        made it such a cozy, memorable evening that felt like a little home all on its own.</p>

                        Fanya. She approved, of course! It was full of laughter, chatter, and a little nervous

                    <p>The day after Shabbat, we went to the Opera to see La Bohème. Dressed up and excited, we shared
                        whispers and smiles during the performance, feeling like two tiny adventurers in a grand,

                    <p>Matthew met my parents for the first time. Stories were shared, jokes landed, and by the end
                        of
                        the night, it felt like a warm welcome we’d both hoped for. My mom joked that he doesn’t
                        play an
                        instrument or chess—clearly, there was no tiger mom—but he passed with flying colors anyway.
                        Then we took a stroll to Ouri's kosher grocery store on 68th and 3rd. We both love grocery
                        stores.</p>
