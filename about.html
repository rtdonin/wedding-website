                    <h3>First Conversation</h3>
                    <p>We met via a matchmaker on SawYouAtSinai.com. On our first phone call, Rita thought Matthew was a
                        little pretentious…until she realized he was a nerd just like her. We laughed, talked some more,
                        and texted afterward, both secretly excited about where this might go.

                    <h3>First Date</h3>
                    <p>Rita came down to D.C., and we spent our first date walking along the National Mall after dinner.
                        Her feet got blisters, but she barely noticed. We were too busy talking, laughing, and swapping
                        stories. Matthew’s <s>never ending</s> riffing suggesting that the hollow-sounding central grate
                        at the D.C. War Memorial was the entrance to the Mole People Embassy apparently convinced Rita
                        he was the real deal. By the end of the night, we knew we wanted more adventures together.

                    <h3>Philadelphia Day Trip</h3>
                    <p>Our third date was a day trip to Philadelphia. We wandered around the city, shared snacks, and
                        laughed at little things only we seemed to notice. We sent each other a postcard from the Museum
                        of the American Revolution. By the end of the day, we were already collecting inside jokes that
                        would stick with us forever.

                    <h3>First Shabbat Together</h3>
                    <p>Rita invited herself over for Shabbat, and in hindsight, we’re both so happy she did. Otherwise,
                        due to various circumstances, it would have been over a month before we saw each other again!
                        Rita met some of Matthew’s friends, and experienced one of his over-the-top feasts, for the
                        first time.

                    <p>For Chanukkah, Matthew sent Rita a stuffed penguin, who is now named Flipper Waddlesworth.

                        Matthew came up to NYC to attend. That’s the day he met Rita’s sister, Fanya. She approved, of
                        course!

                    <p>The day after Shabbat, we went to the Opera to see La Bohème. Rita's mother claims this was
                        'torturing' Matthew.

                    <h3>Meeting Rita's Parents</h3>
                    <p>Matthew met Rita’s parents for the first time. Stories were shared, jokes landed, and by the end
                        of lunch, it felt like a warm welcome we’d both hoped for. Rita’s mom joked that he doesn’t play
                        an instrument or chess, incorrectly inferring the lack of a tiger mom—but he passed with flying
                        colors anyway. Then we took a stroll to Ouri's kosher grocery store on 68th and 3rd. We both
                        love grocery stores, but Matthew suspected Rita was showing him how great the kosher grocery
                        stores are in New York City as proof of the city’s superiority. “This must be how Yeltsin felt,”
                        he thought to himself.
