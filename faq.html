        <p>Whether you’re Jewish or not, religious or secular, attending an Orthodox Jewish wedding is a chance to
            experience a living tradition that’s thousands of years old — full of music, ritual, joy, and meaning. As
            part of our efforts to ensure a joyful, holy, and inclusive celebration, this guide will help you feel
            informed, welcomed, and comfortable throughout.</p>

        <p>In Jewish tradition, a wedding isn’t just about two people — it’s about building a future, continuing a
            legacy, and creating joy for the entire community.</p>

        <p>That’s why you may hear ancient prayers, see people dancing their hearts out, or notice moments of deep
            quiet. These traditions connect the couple to generations past and future — and invite everyone present to
            be part of something greater.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">STAGES OF THE WEDDING DAY</h2>
        <p>A traditional Jewish wedding is more than just a ceremony and a party. It is a sacred journey made up of
            distinct stages, each rich with meaning and intention.</p>
        <p>From joyful gatherings to quiet rituals, a Jewish wedding guides the couple through a spiritual
            transformation. These stages weave together community, memory, tradition, and love.</p>
        <p>Here's what to expect, and why each step matters:</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">KABBALAT PANIM & TISCH: TWO PATHS TO THE SAME JOY</h3>
        <p>Before the ceremony, guests are invited to two simultaneous pre-wedding gatherings. You’re welcome to attend
            one or both, no matter your background or sex.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">Kabbalat Panim - “Welcoming the Bride”</h4>
        <p>This is a warm, elegant reception for the bride, often with soft music, light refreshments, and a chance to
            greet her personally. The tradition is rooted in the biblical image of welcoming royalty — and here, the
            bride is queen for the day.</p>
        <p>Friends and family may offer blessings or words of encouragement, and the atmosphere is typically calm and
            heartfelt.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">Tisch - “The Groom’s Table”</h4>
        <p>At the same time, the groom hosts a tisch, or “table,” where he is surrounded by (traditionally-male, but all
            are welcome at our tisch) friends and relatives. It can be loud, joyful, and slightly chaotic — filled with
            singing, toasts, jokes, and spirited interruptions.</p>
        <p>The tisch is a centuries-old Eastern European tradition where the groom shares words of Torah, and his
            community literally sings him through it – or, depending on the tradition, ensures sufficient interruptions
            he can’t actually get through more than a token portion of his speech.</p>
        <p>Feel free to float between the two gatherings — both are open to all guests. They reflect different emotional
            notes of the day: quiet reverence and noisy support. Together, they form a beautiful whole.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">BEDEKEN – THE VEILING OF THE BRIDE</h3>
        <p>After the pre-wedding receptions, the groom is joyfully escorted to the bride, often through energetic
            dancing.</p>
        <p>In this powerful moment, he lowers her veil, symbolizing recognition and modesty, and affirming that he
            chooses her with intention and clarity.</p>
        <p>As the bride and groom are traditionally not allowed to see each other or communicate for a full week before
            the wedding, it also serves as a sweet moment of reunion before the ceremony.</p>
        <p>This tradition recalls the biblical story of Rebecca veiling herself before marrying Isaac, It also recalls
            the biblical story of Jacob learning the hard way that you’ve got to check this kind of thing.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">KETUBAH – THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT</h3>
        <p>Before the ceremony begins, the couple participates in the signing of the ketubah — the Jewish marriage
            contract. This document outlines the groom’s responsibilities and is rooted in over 2,000 years of Jewish
            legal tradition. Originally written in Aramaic, the ketubah affirms the groom’s obligations to provide
            support, dignity, and care within the marriage.</p>
        <p>It will be conducted in a small, reverent gathering just before the ceremony, but is open to all guests to
            witness.</p>
        <p>The ketubah is a powerful moment of commitment — a reminder that Jewish marriage is not only a celebration,
            but a binding covenant based on responsibility, respect, and sacred intention.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">KASHRUT</h3>
        <p>All food will be kosher, meaning prepared in accordance with Jewish dietary laws. This will be a meat meal,
            meaning there will be no dairy served.</p>
        <p>Please don’t bring outside food or drink — even something small — as it can create complications for
            observant guests and get us in trouble with the kosher inspectors.</p>
