        <p>Whether you're Jewish or not, religious or secular, attending an Orthodox Jewish wedding is a chance to
            experience a living tradition that's thousands of years old, full of music, ritual, joy, and meaning. As
            part of our efforts to ensure a joyful, holy, and inclusive celebration, this guide will help you feel
            informed, welcomed, and comfortable throughout.</p>

        <p>In Jewish tradition, a wedding isn't just about two people; it's about building a future, continuing a
            legacy, embracing our heritage, and creating joy for the entire community.</p>

        <p>That's why you will hear ancient prayers, see people dancing their hearts out, or notice moments of deep
            quiet. These traditions connect the couple to generations past and future and invite everyone present to
            be part of something greater.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Stages of the Wedding Day</h2>
        <p>A traditional Jewish wedding is more than just a ceremony and a party. It is a sacred journey made up of
            distinct stages, each rich with meaning and intention.</p>
        <p>From joyful gatherings to quiet rituals, a Jewish wedding guides the couple through a spiritual
            transformation. These stages weave together community, memory, tradition, and love.</p>
        <p>Here's what to expect, and why each step matters:</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Kabbalat Panim & Tisch: Two Paths to the Same Joy</h3>
        <p>Before the ceremony, guests are invited to two simultaneous pre-wedding gatherings. You're welcome to attend
            one or both, no matter your background or sex.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">Kabbalat Panim - "Welcoming the Bride"</h4>
        <div class="kabbalat-panim-highlight">
            <p>This is a warm, elegant reception for the bride, often with soft music, light refreshments, and a chance
                to
                greet her personally. The tradition is rooted in the biblical image of welcoming royalty; here, the
                bride is queen for the day.</p>
            <p>It is common to ask the bride for a blessing on this special day. The atmosphere is typically calm and
                heartfelt.</p>
            <p>At some point before the next part of the celebration the mother of the bride and the mother of the groom
                partake in the joint effort of breaking a plate, symbolic of the commitment being made. This tradition
                carries the wish that just as the breaking of a plate is irreversible, so too may the wedding be
                irreversible.</p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="text-center">Tisch - "The Groom's Table"</h4>
        <div class="tisch-highlight">
            <p>At the same time, the groom hosts a tisch, or "table," where he is surrounded by (traditionally-male, but
                all
                are welcome at our tisch) friends and relatives. It can be loud, joyful, and slightly chaotic, filled
                with
                singing, toasts, jokes, and spirited interruptions.</p>
            <p>The tisch is a centuries-old Eastern European tradition where the groom shares words of Torah, and his
                community literally sings him through it or, depending on the tradition, ensures sufficient
                interruptions
                he can't actually get through more than a token portion of his speech.</p>
            <p>Feel free to float between the two gatherings and grab a plate and a drink; both events are open to all
                guests. They reflect different emotional notes of the day: quiet reverence and noisy support. Together,
                they form a beautiful whole.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-center">Bedeken – The Veiling of the Bride</h3>
        <p>After the pre-wedding receptions, the groom is joyfully escorted to the bride, with energetic dancing.</p>
        <p>Additionally, this tradition recalls the biblical story of Leah veiling herself before marrying Jacob. It
            also recalls the biblical story of Jacob learning the hard way that you've got to check this kind of
            thing.</p>
        <p>As the bride and groom are traditionally not allowed to see each other or communicate for a full week before
            the wedding, it also serves as a sweet moment of reunion before the ceremony.</p>
        <p>This is the time to start heading towards the location of the chuppah and to find a seat to watch the couple
            get married. There is separate seating for men and women during the ceremony.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Ketubah – The Marriage Contract</h3>
        <p>Before the ceremony begins, the couple participates in the signing of the ketubah — the Jewish marriage
            contract. This document outlines the groom's responsibilities and is rooted in over 2,000 years of Jewish
            legal tradition. Originally written in Aramaic, the ketubah affirms the groom's obligations to provide
            support, dignity, and care within the marriage.</p>
        <p>It will be conducted in a small gathering just before the ceremony.</p>
        <p>The ketubah is a powerful moment of commitment. It is a reminder that Jewish marriage is not only a
            celebration, but a binding covenant based on responsibility, respect, and sacred intention.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Halakhic Prenup</h3>
        <p>In Jewish law, the husband has the sole right to grant a divorce, occasionally leading to bad actors
            preventing their spouse from remarrying. As more traditional means of community "persuasion" are now
            frowned upon by secular legal authorities, a civil contract called a "Halakhic Prenup" was devised to
            compel this by legal means. Therefore, we will also be signing a Halakhic Prenup, in order to model and
            promote the norm that no Jewish wedding should occur without one.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Chuppah – The Wedding Canopy & The Ceremony Proper</h3>
        <p>The betrothal and wedding ceremonies take place under the chuppah, an open-sided canopy symbolizing the
            couple's new home: open, welcoming, and sacred. Its openness reminds us that all who enter the couple's
            life should feel welcome. We ask that you silence your cellphones and put them away for the ceremony. Our
            photographers will take care of the photos and videos allowing you to be fully focused on this beautiful
            moment.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">Procession</h4>
        <p>There will be a bridal procession featuring immediate family, as well as the bride and groom.</p>
        <p>In a nod to American traditions, there will also be a flower girl, a ring bearer, and bridesmaids and
            groomsmen, who will be in the procession, but will join the rest of the guests in the front row.</p>
        <p>We do not "give the bride away" in Jewish tradition. While holding hands with her mother and soon to be
            mother-in-law the bride circles the groom 7 times, symbolizing spiritual protection and connection. The
            tradition comes from Jeremiah 31:21, "A woman shall surround a man," since it is the wife who creates the
            environment of love, beauty, and family loyalty. (Rita wrote this paragraph, we swear).</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">Erusin (Betrothal Blessings) & Ketubah Reading</h4>
        <p>The betrothal blessings will be said. After that, the ketubah will be read in (mostly) Aramaic. This will
            be followed by an explanation of the ketubah's contents in English. The groom then makes a vow to the bride
            and gives her the wedding ring. The couple is now betrothed.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">Sheva Brachot (The Seven Blessings)</h4>
        <p>During the ceremony, seven ancient blessings are recited over the couple to bless, congratulate, and pray
            for the groom and bride. The blessings cover many themes—the creation of the world and of humanity, the
            survival of the Jewish people and of Israel, marriage, the couple's happiness and the raising of family.</p>
        <p>It puts the state of marriage into a dynamic relationship with the beginning and end of history—the Garden
            of Eden and the expectation of the Messiah. The first three blessings have nothing directly to say about
            the marriage itself, but they form the foundation of the nuptial benedictions that follow.</p>
        <p>The last blessing is the culmination of rejoicing, with the chanting of ten synonyms of joy that reach a
            crescendo in the praising of God who rejoices for the groom and bride.</p>
        <p>Even if you don't understand the Hebrew, the melodies and emotion make it easy to feel the weight and beauty
            of the moment.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">Breaking the Glass</h4>
        <div class="mazel-tov">
            <p>At the ceremony's end, the groom stomps on a glass — and the crowd erupts with "Mazel Tov!"</p>
        </div>
        <p>This dramatic moment has two main interpretations. Even in our happiest moments we must, nevertheless,
            remember Jerusalem, and yearn for our imminent return there and to rebuild our Temple in the Holy Land.</p>
        <p>This moment is also a metaphor for the finality of the bond that has been established. Just as a broken
            glass can never be reconstructed, so, too, we pray that this relationship lasts forever.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">The Celebration: Music, Food, and Dance</h2>
        <h3 class="text-center">After the Ceremony</h3>
        <p>Everyone heads to the reception!</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the couple spends a few private minutes together (yichud). This is the first time in a week that
            they get to speak to each other. These are the first moments they get to spend as husband and wife.</p>
        <p>Once the newlyweds are ready to join the reception, please come to the dance floor to welcome them!</p>
        <p>Now we celebrate with food, music, and dancing!</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Dancing (Separate but Joyful)</h3>
        <p>Orthodox weddings typically have separate dancing for men and women, often with live music and wild
            enthusiasm. It's less about performance and more about lifting up the couple with joy.</p>
        <p>Expect spinning circles, jumping, clapping — even the bride and groom being lifted on chairs. If you want to
            join in, you're more than welcome!</p>
        <p>The Talmud teaches that making a bride and groom happy is a great mitzvah (good deed), so people dance with
            abandon, — not to show off, but to lift up the couple's joy.</p>
        <p>While the dancing continues, don't forget to hydrate!</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Customs, Protocols, & Cultural Notes</h2>

        <h3 class="text-center">Kashrut</h3>
        <p>All food will be kosher, meaning prepared in accordance with Jewish dietary laws. This will be a meat meal,
            meaning there will be no dairy served. A large variety of food from a mix of cultures is traditional at
            Jewish wedding buffets, so there should be something for everyone.</p>
        <p>Please don't bring outside food or drink — even something small — as it can create complications for
            observant guests and get us in trouble with the kosher inspectors.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Languages You Will Hear</h3>
        <p>The ceremony will include English, Hebrew, and Aramaic components. Prayers and blessings will mostly be in
            Hebrew, while the rest will be primarily conducted in English. You don't need to understand it to
            appreciate it. Just listen, take it in, and join in with a smile or "Amen" if you feel comfortable. If you
            don't understand something, please ask!</p>
        <p>Due to the family heritage of Rita and Matthew, those giving toasts are welcome and likely to do so in
            English, Russian, or both.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Shomer Negiah ("Guarding of the Touch")</h3>
        <p>Some Orthodox Jews, including some guests at this wedding, observe shomer negiah, meaning that they avoid
            physical contact with members of the opposite sex who aren't immediate family.</p>
        <p>When interacting with religious strangers of the opposite sex, instead of hugs or handshakes, a smile and
            kind words are perfect! Perhaps a head bow or even a head bow and a hand on your heart. There are
            options.</p>
        <p>Don't worry if you forget; it is a common occurrence that your fellow guests have learned to navigate. It
            will not be taken as a slight, and concern not to unnecessarily embarrass those who seek a handshake in
            error is also a Jewish tenet.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center" id="dress-code">Showing Respect Through Attire</h3>
        <p>Attire at our wedding is Black Tie Optional.</p>
        <p>Men are encouraged to wear tuxedos, or else a suit and tie.</p>
        <p>Women should wear an outfit they feel beautiful in. The outfit should have a high neckline that also covers
            the knees when sitting. Sheer, sleeveless, backless, low-cut, high slit, and midriff-bearing attire are
            considered inappropriate for this event.</p>
        <p>By special request of the bride, please leave your tiaras, jumpsuits, and pant suits at home.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Head Coverings</h3>
        <p>It is customary and respectful for men to wear kippot (AKA yarmulkes, skullcaps, "little hats", yamakas,
            etc.) at Jewish religious events.</p>
        <p>It symbolizes that G-D is above us, but it's a cultural tradition rather than a religious commandment, and
            comes with no other inherent theological or sectarian commitments or implications.</p>
        <p>Some married women choose to cover their heads in some fashion, especially during the ceremony. However, a
            kippa is a male garment.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Final Note: YOU Belong Here</h2>
        <p>You don't need to be Jewish, religious, or familiar with any of this to be a beloved guest. Your presence
            helps bless our new life, and we are grateful for everyone who comes to celebrate with us. If we invited
            you, it means we very much want you to celebrate with us.</p>
        <p>We hope your time at our wedding is joyful and comfortable. And if this is your first Orthodox wedding,
            hopefully an interesting and positive cultural experience.</p>
        <p>If you're unsure what to do at any moment, just look around — or ask. People will be happy to help.</p>
        <p>So dress up, dance (or clap along), and take it all in. It's a celebration like no other.</p>

        <p><strong>With Love,<br>
                Rita & Matthew</strong></p>

        <p><strong>PS</strong> - If you have any questions or concerns between now and the day of the wedding, please
            ask us.
            No question should be left unanswered when the answer would allow you, our honored guest, to feel
            comfortable.</p>
